Now my previous code is it ready to push to production: No

For that u have to do alot of processing to push it on production. You need to bundling,code splitting,chunking, image optimization,need to remove the comments, minify the code ,compress it.

What is needed to make you app to go to production

Can react itself do it: There are alot of packages which are required to make production ready app or app fast.


npm: Its is not node packages manager.npm manages packages. IT is standart repository for all the packages. Any package that u want to use in your application. U can use npm. All the packages are hosted over there. All the librarries ,utilities comes from npm and npm manages that for you in your project when u create a basic react app , it automaticalky have npm inside it 
u dont have to configure it.

But we will learn how our project use npm. Lets add npm to our project
